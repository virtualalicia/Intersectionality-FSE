        <h2>About the Workshop and Organizers</h2>
        <p>This inagural workshop focusing on intersectionality as a foundation of software engineering, both in education and in practice,
            will be held in Trondheim, Norway on June 25th as a part of the 2025 Foundations of Software Engineering conference.</p>
            <p>All of the program committee members are part of the COST Action CA19122 EUGAIN.</p>
            <p>Claudia Maria Cutrupi is a PhD Candidate at the Department of Computer Science of the Norwegian University of Science 
                and Technology (NTNU) conducting her doctoral research on Gender Diversity and IT, specifically on 
                the designing of human-centered intervention that address the lack of diversity in Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>Javier Gomez is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid 
                (UAM), Madrid, Spain researching technologies to support people with special needs.</p>
            <p>Filomena Ferrucci is a full professor of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Salerno,
                 Italy Empirical Software Engineering with a focus on Cultural and Socio-Technical Aspects in Software Development, 
                 Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Science Education. </p>
            <p>Alicia Julia Wilson Takaoka is a postdoctoral researcher at Erasmus University Rotterdam focusing on AI, data, and 
                digitalization for an inclusive and fair energy transition. </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>

        <p>Software and smart devices are becoming more embedded in our daily lives. 
            Ethical concerns about omissions of groups of people and the biases of developers have come under rightful scrutiny by researchers 
            and the general public. Our increased dependence on the built environment and those who make it require critical examination and 
            reflection. In this inaugural workshop, we examine intersectionality, which is the recognition that individual categorizations 
            like race and gender create interdependent systems of discrimination or systemic disadvantage, as a requirement in software 
            engineering education and foundational in software engineering. Submissions examining the team composition, management practices, 
            user perspectives, products in development or in use, processes that guide hiring practices or workplace culture, and policies that 
            govern aspects of software development are encouraged.
            This workshop explores the importance of intersectionality as a foundational concept in software engineering.</p>
            
            <p>The use of networked technologies to highlight the state of academia and work in recent years has led to intense 
            polarization and fragmentation across cultural, political, and geographic boundaries. In response, empirical software 
            engineering researchers have produced results that indicate the need for changes to software engineering practices, 
            policies, and team composition, hiring, and education through sustainability and inclusion. This work impacts teams, users, 
            and organizations software and applications are designed and deployed. An example of this is seen in the EU AI Act and the 
            call to create AI, algorithmic, and autonomous systems auditing methods and impartial auditors.</p>

        <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
        <p>This workshop theme is “Intersectionality, diversity, and inclusion as foundational to software engineering.” It offers an 
            opportunity to focus scholarly attention on the social, cultural, political, and economic examination and shaping of 
            software engineering practices, policies, and their consequences. This emphasis invites a range of scholarly inquiries, 
            such as how to uncover bias in algorithms, question the western-centric development of AI, and evaluate accessible learning 
            software. Submissions for the workshop may include empirical, critical and theoretical work, as well as richly described 
            practice cases and demonstrations. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
            <ul>
              <li>Best practices for promoting intersectionality, diversity, and inclusion</li> 
              <li>Digital equity and digital divide</li> 
              <li>Intersectional issues in generative AI</li> 
              <li>Feminist methodologies in empirical software engineering</li> 
              <li>Inclusive and identity-aware technology design, implementation, and use</li> 
              <li>Software engineering policy interventions to promote equity and justice</li>
              <li>Tool development and testing for diversity, equity, and inclusion</li> 
              <li>Implications and socio-political influence of ICTs</li> 
              <li>Re-conceptualizing SE concepts, methods, frameworks, and theories through a critical lens</li> 
            </ul>
