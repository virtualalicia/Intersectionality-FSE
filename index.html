        <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
        <p>Software and smart devices are becoming more embedded in our daily lives. 
            Ethical concerns about omissions of groups of people and the biases of developers have come under rightful scrutiny by researchers 
            and the general public. Our increased dependence on the built environment and those who make it require critical examination and 
            reflection. In this inaugural workshop, we examine intersectionality, which is the recognition that individual categorizations 
            like race and gender create interdependent systems of discrimination or systemic disadvantage, as a requirement in software 
            engineering education and foundational in software engineering. Submissions examining the team composition, management practices, 
            user perspectives, products in development or in use, processes that guide hiring practices or workplace culture, and policies that 
            govern aspects of software development are encouraged.
            This workshop explores the importance of intersectionality as a foundational concept in software engineering.</p>
